## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the program, you should have python and pip installed :

- Python : [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you want to clone the repository using git, you should also have it installed :

- Git : [Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing

First of all, you will have to clone the repository (or download the zip file) from GitHub

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MAT34525/AES-Decker-CDOF3
```

Once you downloaded the project, move to the project folder

```powershell
cd AES-Decker-CDOF3
```

Then install the dependencies and build the package using :

```powershell
pip install .
```

## Running the tests

To run simple tests, you should simply run the project using the  `-T` flag :

```powershell
python main.py -T
```

## Usages

```powershell
python main.py [commands] [options]
```

usage: 
  
    AES [-h] (-T | -E | -D) [-kr size | -kb hex | -kt text] [-dr size | -dt text | -df path] [-ob | -ot | -of path]

options:
  
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

MODE: Choose one of the following modes

    -T                    Tests the tool
    -E                    Encrypt data using the information provided
    -D                    Decrypt data using the information provided

KEY: Choose one of the following commands to insert the key

    -kr size, --key-random size
                          Key from size of a randomly generated byte array (size >= 16)
    
    -kb hex, --key-bytes hex
                          Key from bytes in hexadecimal format
    
    -kt text, --key-text text
                          Key from text

DATA: Choose one of the following commands to insert the data to be encrypted / decrypted

    -dr size, --data-random size
                          Data from size of a randomly generated byte array
    
    -dt text, --data-text text
                          Data from text
    
    -df path, --data-file path
                          Data from file using a path

OUTPUT: Choose one of the following commands to output / save the result

    -ob                   Output bytes

    -ot                   Output text
    
    -of path, --out-file path
                          Output file to a path
